## **[ MOTIVATION ]**
Everytime when a project is finished one is required to take a video demo of the working application, sometimes at last moment before actual presentation say a bug has been found or the application breaks or electricity failure etc. the video demo becomes a saviour as the proof of the application status. <br/>
In my case however, I was pretty confident on my demo as I had prepared the best speech and the applicaiton was supposed to speak for itself. Unfortunately, there was electricity failure in my area, just 30 mins were remaining before demo so I started searching all the screen recorders of them I came accross: <br/>

* Windows screen recorder: Pressing button `Windows + G` brings up capture menu in windows 10. **[CON] It can record only 1 application at a time. If you want to record entire screen not a good idea to go with this.**

* VLC media player: Media player which has inbuilt screen recorder.  **[CON] For recording everytime I had to setup the recording configuration.**

In the final moment I had to record in haste with VLC. Quickly uploaded the video demo so that if my laptop goes out back-up will be present. <br/>

I'm creating this small project so that no one else faces such issues again. Not limiting to the above case, this could also be used for making content for youtube, record your gameplays if you have an awesome moment to capture, etc.
